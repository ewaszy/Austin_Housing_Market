### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
SQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask to display the data.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is 80% training and 20% testing. The testing and training data will contain 12 features based on size, previous pricing, and other house descriptions. Our target will be the latestPrice. The goal is to take the 22 features and the target of the training data to accurately retrieve the target, latestPrice.

### Dashboard
In addition to using a Flask template, we will also integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will be hosted on ___.
