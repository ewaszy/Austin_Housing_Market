# Final_Project

## Data Cleaning and Analysis

The dataset we have chosen has over 15 thousand home listings and 45 initial features. While this data is extensive and essential to this project, it needs to be cleaned for duplicate and invalid entries, and scaled down to fit the project better. We will be using the Pandas software to do just that, and for us to see the dataset better. As we analyze the data further we will be using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

## Database
SQL is the database we intend to use to house the database and we will integrate Flask to display the dataset. We will use SQL to display the tables made in Pandas and Python in an concise way that clearly shows the relationships between the columns.
